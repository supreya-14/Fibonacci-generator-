# Fibonacci-generator-
The Fibonacci Generator is a Python-based program created to generate numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. It typically starts with 0 and 1.

This program takes input from the user (number of terms) and displays the corresponding Fibonacci numbers. It helps in understanding the use of loops, variables, and functions in programming. This is a beginner-friendly project that introduces basic logic building and algorithmic thinking.
